# Parsing-Project
Python quiz about web parsing.

this is my first project about web parsing. for this project i scraped georgian website "https://pcroom.ge/".
i got information from 5 pages of this site about mouses and wrote this information in a csv file in 4 columns (name, type, price, currency).
